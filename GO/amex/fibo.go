Fibonacci problem statement:
In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted Fâ‚™, form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence,
such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1.
That is, and for n > 1.
The sequence starts: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...
Write a function which takes positive, integer number N as argument and returns N-th element of Fibonacci sequence.
f(0) = 0
f(1) = 1
f(2) = 1
f(3) = 2
f(4) = 3
f(5) = 5
f(6) = 8
